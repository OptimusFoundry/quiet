# Accessibility

quiet ships an accessibility and motion layer on every component, tested with axe in light and dark
plus keyboard and ARIA specs (`tests/`). The app still owns the page.

## What quiet guarantees

- **Keyboard:** every interactive component works without a mouse. Roving arrows in Tabs, Radio,
  FilterTabs, menus, Sidebar, PromptSuggestions, UndoRiver and chart marks; Escape closes overlays; Enter or Space
  activates.
- **Focus:** a visible keyboard focus ring. Dialog, Drawer and CommandPalette trap focus and restore
  it on close. Removing a chip or undoing an item moves focus somewhere sensible.
- **Names and states:** labelled controls, `aria-expanded/selected/pressed/checked/current`,
  `role=slider|meter|progressbar` with `aria-valuetext`, and live regions for toasts, streaming chat,
  agent steps and table arrivals.
- **Charts:** focusable marks with spoken values, plus a visually hidden data table.
- **Motion:** every duration token drops to 0 under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and loops stop at their
  finished state.

## What the app must do

- **Page title:** set `document.title` on every route ("Builds · Anvil · Sjocamp"), and use one `h1`
  (`PageHero as="h1"`).
- **Landmarks:** one `<main>` (`PageShell as="main"` or your own). When a page has more than one
  `Sidebar`, `Breadcrumb` or `Pagination`, give each a distinct `label` / `aria-label`.
- **Route changes:** move focus to the new page's `h1` (or main) after client-side navigation, and
  announce the title if your router doesn't.
- **Labels:** every field gets `label`. Icon-only buttons need an accessible name. Use `hideLabel`
  (TextField) rather than omitting the label.
- **Errors:** pass messages through the field's `error` prop so they're tied to the input. After a
  failed submit, move focus to the first invalid field.
- **Headings:** keep the order h1 → h2 → h3. `SectionHeader` and `PageHero` take `as`, so use it to
  keep the outline right.
- **Live updates you build yourself:** use one polite live region per surface. Don't announce every token or
  every row.
- **Time limits:** toasts with actions must stay long enough to reach (errors 6s). Anything that must
  not be missed goes to the notification centre.
- **Hit targets:** at least 32px high (`size="sm"`), and never smaller.

## Contrast exceptions

Two colour choices are kept exactly as designed and accepted in the axe tests:

| Token | Contrast | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `--q-fg-subtle` (muted-2) | ≈2.98:1 | non-essential text only: decorative serials, dimmed future items |
| small molten text | ≈3.87:1 | short punctuation-like labels only; never body copy or a sole error message |

Everything a user must read uses `--q-fg-muted` or darker. An error message's words are in body ink, and
only its mark is molten.
